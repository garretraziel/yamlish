Based on Data-YAML version 0.0.6 (Copyright (C) 2007, Andy Armstrong), but it
is so thoroughly rewritten that I don't consider it derived work and I don't
feel the need to resolve what "This library is free software; you can
redistribute it and/or modify it under the same terms as Perl itself." actually
means.
