YAMLishWriter.php Version 0.0.1

This is a simple implementation of a YAMLish writer for PHP. See

    http://testanything.org/wiki/index.php/YAMLish
  
for more information about YAMLish.

You can find the YAMLishWriter class in lib/yamlishwriter.php in this
distribution. YAMLishWriter is a self contained PHP class. To use it

    // Or wherever it is on your include path
    include('yamlishwriter.php');
    
    // And then later
    $writer = new YAMLishWriter;
    
    $data = array( 'got' => 1, 'expected' => 2 );
    $output = $writer->write($data);
    
The returned value is an array containing the lines of YAMLish.

This distribution contains a rudimentary test harness for which you'll
need Perl prove command. To run the tests edit Makefile to reflect the
location of your php command and then

    make test
